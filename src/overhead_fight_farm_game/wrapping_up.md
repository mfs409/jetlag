## Wrapping Up

This game brings together a lot of ideas, especially animations, session
storage, and state machines.  You probably found yourself thinking "that's
really ugly code" on more than one occasion.  Once you start to think that about
your own game, it's probably time to stop and rewrite some of your code in
separate functions (and maybe even separate files), so that nothing gets too
overwhelming.
