# Example: An Overhead Fighting/Farming Game

This web page presents the start of a game with an overhead perspective,
involving fighting (via `punch()`) and something kind of like farming or
crafting.  As an "example", rather than a "tutorial", you will not find much
discussion of how the game was made.  You should be sure to read through the
code to get a better understanding.
