## Wrapping Up

This chapter introduced **a lot** of new features.  It showed how we can make
small changes to achieve big differences in our games, and it explained how the
camera and gravity work together to define the perspective in a game.  It might
be a good idea to read through it again, just to make sure you're comfortable
with all of these ideas.  Then be sure to move on to the next chapter, where we
learn more about the physics simulation.
