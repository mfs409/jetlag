# Roles that Actors Play

In JetLag, actors take on roles, like "Hero" or "Obstacle".  Each role in JetLag
has several purposes.  For starters, each role defines things that it does and
does not appear to collide with.  For example, `Passive` (the default role, which
an actor takes if you don't give it anything else) actors never collide with
each other.

```admonish Note
The `Projectile` role is special, so we'll leave its discussion to a chapter
that's all about projectiles.
