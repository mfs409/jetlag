## Wrapping Up

The roles we discussed in this tutorial are all conveniences.  In the next
tutorial, we'll see that the `Obstacle` role could be used to do everything that
any of these roles can do.  However, sometimes it's convenient to use these
roles... it means less code, and it means the code is easier to read, because we
can just see a word like "Goodie" and know exactly what an actor is supposed to
do.

In this tutorial, we saw that Heroes, Obstacles, and Enemies are more advanced
and robust than the other roles.  As an exercise, you should think about how you
could use Obstacles in place of Goodies, Destinations, and Sensors.  Then you
should try to come up with a reason why you couldn't use Obstacles in place of
Heroes or Enemies.  If your understanding is very good, then you could even
propose what change JetLag would need in order for Obstacles to be able to serve
as if they were Heroes and Enemies.
