# Graphical Assets

This tutorial starts our in-depth discussion of the different ways that you can
control the appearance of an Actor.  We've already looked at `TextSprite`, so
now we'll focus on the different "filled" shapes, as well as the `ImageSprite`.

- About color codes for those filledsprites (include transparency)
- No spaces in names!
- Changing images/animations without making new components
- Z index!
