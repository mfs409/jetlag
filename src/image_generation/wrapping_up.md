## Wrapping Up

The same technique that you saw in this chapter can also be used to customize
`AnimatedSprites`.  There, you'll want to use a `PixiSprite` instead of a file
name when indicating how to draw each cell of the animation.

You should expect that it will take at least a few hundreds of lines of code to
make an effective character selection screen for an animated character.  You
should also expect that it will take a lot of trial and error to get the images
and the code to work nicely together.  However, when you finish, you might be
surprised at how much of an impact it has on your users.  Some people will spend
a *long time* getting their character to be just right, and they'll thank you
for making it possible for them to express themselves in the appearance of their
characters.
