JetLag, in its various forms, has been used by more than 1,000 students at
Lehigh University.  It's hard to quantify all of the ways that those
students' experiences have influenced JetLag's design.  To every student who
has used "ALE", "LibLOL", or "JetLag", **thank you** for helping to make
JetLag the best it can be.

In addition to those unnamed students, the following people have contributed
to JetLag:

- Mike Spear
- Dan Spear
- Greyson Parrelli
- Jennifer Bayzick
- Rachel Santangelo
- Micah Carlisle
- Maximilian Hasselbusch
- Jimmy Johnson
- Marc Soda
- Egide Ntwari
- Nana Nyanor
