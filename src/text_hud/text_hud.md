# Text and the Heads-Up Display

This tutorial discusses the ways that you can create text that appears in your
game.  It also introduces the heads-up display (HUD).

As you work through this tutorial, there are some important questions that
you'll want to get into the habit of asking yourself whenever you write code:

- When will this code run?
- Where will this actor be drawn?
- What should happen when the text size changes?
