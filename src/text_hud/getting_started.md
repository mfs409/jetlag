## Getting Started

This tutorial needs the following assets.  You should download them both to your
`assets` folder.

- [green_ball.png](text_hud/green_ball.png)
- [Roboto-Black.ttf](text_hud/Roboto-Black.ttf)

Then be sure to add `green_ball.png` to `imageNames` in your `Config` object.

Lastly, be sure to remove all code from your `builder()` function.
