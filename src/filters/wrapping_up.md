## Wrapping Up

In this chapter, we saw how filters can be applied to parts of (or all of) your
game screen.  As you experiment with filters, it's important to keep in mind the
kind of device that you think people will have when they play your game.  If
your users are going to be on mobile devices, or old computers, you may need a
way to make the filters optional, or else you'll risk having a bad experience.
But when used well, filters can make your game *much* more visually appealing
and fun.
