## Wrapping Up

Whew, that was a lot of background.  If you didn't read the whole chapter,
that's fine.  If you don't understand everything you read, that's fine too.  All
that matters right now is that you have a few places to look if you find that
you're getting confused.

As keep working through this book, remember that there are no secret tricks for
learning how to program.  It's like juggling... you can only learn by doing it.
When you start, you'll make a lot of mistakes, and some of them will be hard to
figure out.  Don't be discouraged.  Ask for help, take a break, look at the
problem from a different perspective, and you'll figure it out.  

At this point, it would be a good idea to take a break and stretch your legs.
Then move on to the next chapter, and start learning how to make games!
