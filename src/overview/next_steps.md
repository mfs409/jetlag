## Next Steps

If you have been following along in your code, now would be a great time to try
to make some changes.  You might want to change the positions of the actors, or
change their dimensions.  Perhaps you want to change their appearance, maybe
even making the appearance different from the underlying rigidBody.  You could
also change the key behavior (for example, by increasing or decreasing the
velocity).  At some point, you might also want to set `hitBoxes` to `false`, to
see how everything's appearance changes, and becomes much cleaner!

Before you move on to the next chapter, you should reset your `game.ts` file.
You can get the original copy [here](game.ts).
