## Wrapping Up

Hopefully this example will be a gateway into thinking about
procedurally-generated content. You should have seen that "random" isn't always
good.  It's worth thinking about ways to use some kind of constrained randomness
to create a new and different game experience each time, while still ensuring
that the game is playable, fun, and not repetitive.  For example, if you had
twenty 64-meter-long chunks of world, each of which had a few ways to customize
it, you could easily have several thousand meters of gameplay before anything
seemed to repeat.
