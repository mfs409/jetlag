## Wrapping Up

In this tutorial, we saw ways of either *not* using a collision, or using a
collision differently than what was possible in the previous tutorials.  Perhaps
the most important point is that none of these features was part of my original
design for JetLag... they all came later, in response to needs that students
raised.  If you think you need a new feature in JetLag, please contact me!
