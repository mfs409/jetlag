## Wrapping Up

In this chapter, we saw ways of either *not* using a collision, or using a
collision differently than what was possible in the previous chapters.  Perhaps
the most important point is that none of these features was part of my original
design for JetLag... they all came later, in response to needs that students
raised.  In addition, they all were just a matter of using some of the features
of Box2D that were already there, so none of them were too hard to create.  If
you think you need a new feature in JetLag, please contact me!
