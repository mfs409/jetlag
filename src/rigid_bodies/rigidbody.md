# Rigid Bodies and Physics

Now that you've seen a few different mini-games and have a bit of a sense for
what the code looks like when you're making a game in JetLag, it's time to start
going into more depth.  Each of the next few chapters tries to describe all of
the parts of some component or feature of JetLag.  You don't need to read
everything in each chapter... if your goal is to make a specific game, you
should feel free to skip around and focus on the things that will help you to
make that game.  But if you are not sure what kind of game you want to make,
then reading these chapters might provide some inspiration.

To start it off, this chapter discusses important details related to the Box2D
physics simulation, such as rigid body types, physics properties, gravity,
shapes, and tilt.
