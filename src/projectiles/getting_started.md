## Getting Started

This chapter requires the following supporting code:

- [common.ts](common.ts)

It also needs the following files in the `assets` folder:

- [sprites.json](../assets/sprites.json)
- [sprites.png](../assets/sprites.png)

 Since some of the examples involve winning and losing, you'll probably want to
put these two lines at the top of your `builder()` function:

```typescript
{{#include game_01.ts:24:25}}
```
