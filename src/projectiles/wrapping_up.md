## Wrapping Up

Projectiles are very customizable.  Each time we changed just one argument to
the role or movement, we saw a different kind of game behavior emerge.  As
you look through other uses of projectiles in the other chapters of this
book, you'll find even more.  For the most part, they're closely related to
what you saw in this chapter.  However, there is a *third* way of tossing
projectiles, which isn't in this chapter at all: "punching".  Punching is a
way to glue a projectile to an actor, so it serves as a sort of hit box.
This could be a punch, a melee weapon, or other behavior.  If you're
interested, be sure to look at the "combat" section of the "farming and
fighting" game.
