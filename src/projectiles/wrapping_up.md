## Wrapping Up

Projectiles are very customizable.  Each time we changed just one argument to
the role or movement, we saw a different kind of game behavior emerge.  As you
look through other uses of projectiles in the tutorial series, you'll find even
more.  For the most part, they're closely related to what you saw in this
tutorial.  However, there is a *third* way of tossing projectiles, which isn't
in this tutorial at all: "punching".  Punching is a way to glue a projectile to
an actor, so it serves as a sort of hit box.  This could be a punch, a melee
weapon, or other behavior.  If you're interested, be sure to look at the
"combat" section of the "farming and fighting" game.
