# Introduction to Simulation: Conway's Game of Life

This chapter is a little bit different.  It doesn't really present an
interactive "game".  It is an implementation of [Conway's Game Of
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). As you play with the
level, you may have new ideas about how a simulated world might need to advance
and manage itself.
