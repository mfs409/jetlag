# Example: Conway's Game of Life

This web page presents an "endless runner" style of game.  As an "example",
rather than a "tutorial", you will not find much discussion of how the game was
made.  You should be sure to read through the code to get a better
understanding.

Also, note that this isn't really an interactive game.  It is an implementation
of [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
As you play with the level, you may have new ideas about how a simulated world
might need to advance and manage itself.
