## Getting Started

To begin, you'll need the "sprites.json", "sprites.png", and "mid.png" files from the Graphical Assets chapter.  We'll add two more files (one spritesheet):

- [alien.png](../assets/alien.png)
- [alien.json](../assets/alien.json)
- [sprites.png](../assets/sprites.png)
- [sprites.json](../assets/sprites.json)
- [mid.png](../assets/mid.png)

(If you're wondering, I used the [Universal LPC Spritesheet
Generator](https://sanderfrenken.github.io/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/)
to make these images.  It gave me one big image, but no .json file, so I had to
cut its image up into a bunch of files, then re-pack them through TexturePacker
to get a .json file.)
