# Animations

This chapter looks at animations.  Animations are one of the more complicated
aspects of JetLag.  You might need to read through this chapter more than once
before it all makes sense.  You should also be sure to do the Graphical Assets
chapter first, since the ideas in it relate to how Animations work.
