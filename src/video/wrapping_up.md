## Wrapping Up

Getting a cut scene into your game is usually not too difficult.  The biggest
challenge is thinking about how your players will feel about it.  It's probably
a good idea to make it possible to skip cut scenes, and also to re-play them,
especially if they involve important clues or plot elements.
