## Wrapping Up

Storage is a complex topic, so it's a good idea to do whatever you can to keep
it simple.  In this tutorial, we used one object for each of local, session, and
persistent storage.  The next step would be to move these objects to their own
files, and then to make the set-up code into functions, so that we wouldn't need
top copy and paste it into every builder in our game.  As you develop games,
you'll probably find other techniques that help you to keep your storage from
getting too complicated.  It's good to remember that there's no single right
answer... whatever is most intuitive and easy to get right for your game is the
best strategy for you to take!
