# Temporary And Long-Term Storage

This chapter introduces the `level`, `session`, and `persistent` storage
features, which JetLag provides to help you keep track of information during
your game.

In a complex game, where it takes lots of files just to implement one level of
the game, it can be difficult to keep track of all of the information that
matters.  It can get even harder when information needs to flow from one level
to the next (or from the store to the playable parts of the game).  Then there's
the whole question of how to save information so that it's still there the next
time the game runs. These are the kinds of problems that this chapter will help
you to solve.
