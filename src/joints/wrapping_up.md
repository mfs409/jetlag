## Wrapping Up

Joints can provide simple visual effects or be a significant aspect of the
physics of your game.  As an example of the former, using JetLag's support for
revolute joints, it is possible to make "rag doll" bodies that flop around.  For
the latter, Box2D provides many more types of joints.  So moving beyond welding
and flippers/wheels, you could potentially make swords, or use a prismatic joint
as a slider (a forklift?).  There are also pulley joints, gear joints, wheel
joints, rope joints, and friction joints.  There are also motor joints and wheel
joints, for situations where the kind of revolute joints in this chapter aren't
sufficient.  More information can be found in the [Box2D Joint
Documentation](https://box2d.org/documentation/md__d_1__git_hub_box2d_docs_dynamics.html#autotoc_md81).
