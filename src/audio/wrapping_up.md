## Wrapping Up

Sounds are not especially hard to use, but it can be difficult to use them well.
For example, in this tutorial, you probably noticed that some sounds were "too
long", and kept playing long after they should have stopped. If you find
yourself in a situation like this, you might need to introduce some kind of
timer delays, so that your sounds can play out before gameplay resumes.
