# Getting Started

There are two ways to get started with JetLag.  The "easy" way is described
in the next chapter.  It involves using a third party website for all of your
programming.  This is very easy to set up, but it has the disadvantage that
it does not have a way for you to easily share your games or package them for
desktop or mobile.

This chapter describes the harder way, where you need to install some
software on your computer.  This chapter doesn't involve much programming.
It only focuses on getting your computer set up to start writing games.  When
you finish this chapter, you will have a copy of the JetLag code that you are
able to run.  You will be able to use this as the starting point for learning
about how games are made, and also as the starting point for making your own
game.
