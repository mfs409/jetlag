## Getting Started

In this tutorial, we will use the "sprites.json" spritesheet.  You'll want to
make sure you download `sprites.png` and `sprites.json` to your `assets` folder,
and then add `sprites.json` to `imageNames` in your `Config` object.

You should also make sure copy the `boundingBox()` and `enableTilt()` functions
into your `game.ts` file.
