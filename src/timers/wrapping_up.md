## Wrapping Up

As you reflect on this chapter, please keep in mind that the games were not to
show *everything* that timers can do.  Their purpose was to get you started
thinking about time-based events.  Over time, you will find that timers can
serve all sorts of purposes, providing a valuable source of events for the games
you create.
