## Wrapping Up

As you reflect on this tutorial, please keep in mind that the mini-games were
not to show the extend of what timers can do.  Their purpose was to show you
some of the different ways in which you can use timers.  Over time, you will
find that timers can serve all sorts of purposes, providing a valuable source
of events for the games you create.
