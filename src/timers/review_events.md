## Review: Events

Remember that in games, we typically say that there is a simulation that is
running, and events are the way that we change the course of the simulation.
Input (keyboard/mouse/touch) is one source of events that we've studied, and
collisions among actors are another.  The third major source of events is time.

Timed events can be things that happen once (after some amount of time
transpires) or that happen repeatedly (for example, every X milliseconds).  We
can also use timers as a way to "check" for hard-to-explain situations and
correct them.
