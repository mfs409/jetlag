## Wrapping Up

With all of that code written, we now have a pretty nice menu system for our
game:

<iframe src="./game.iframe.html"></iframe>

A very important point about this chapter is that it let us split the game into
several files, and also into logically distinct units.  If you're working in a
team, you will be much more efficient if different team members can avoid
editing the same file at the same time.  This chapter is a great step in that
direction.
