# Keeping Score

In this tutorial, we'll learn about how scores work in JetLag. JetLag tracks a
lot of information while your game is playing, through `stage.score`.

In the second half of this tutorial, we'll explore other ways of winning, and
then we'll look at ways of losing.  And, of course, you may decide that in the
end, you don't want to use JetLag's score at all.  You're always free to keep
score on your own.  If that's the case, you'll probably want to have a look at
the "storage" tutorial for advice about how to keep track of information as you
move from level to level.

This tutorial continues from the previous "Keeping Score" tutorial, and discusses
the remaining ways that JetLag tracks the score.
