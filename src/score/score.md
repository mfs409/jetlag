# Keeping Score

In this chapter, we'll learn about how scores work in JetLag. JetLag tracks a
lot of information while your game is playing, through `stage.score`.

As you work your way through this chapter, keep in mind that you don't *have* to
use the JetLag score facility at all.  Just like `Goodie` and `Destination` are
optional roles, all of the score features are optional.  You're always free to
keep score on your own.  If that's the case, you'll probably want to have a look
at the "storage" chapter for advice about how to keep track of information as
you move from level to level.
