# Getting Started

There are two ways to get started with JetLag.  The "easy" path is to use a
third-party website for all of your programming.  This is very quick to set up,
but it has the disadvantage that it does not have an easy way for you to share
your games or package them for desktop or mobile.

The "hard" path is to install some software on your computer.  This involves a
lot of configuration work, and you won't know if you did it correctly until you
get all the way to the end of the process.

This chapter has three parts.  The first part discusses the common steps that
you will need to take, regardless of which path you choose.  The second and
third parts walk you through setting up JetLag along the two paths.

This chapter doesn't involve any programming. It only focuses on getting your
computer set up to start writing games.  When you finish this chapter, you will
have a copy of the JetLag code that you are able to run.  You will be able to
use this as the starting point for learning about how games are made, and also
as the starting point for making your own game.
