# Getting Started

In this chapter, we will discuss how to get started using JetLag.  This chapter
doesn't involve much programming.  It only focuses on getting your computer set
up to start writing games.  When you finish this chapter, you will have a copy
of the JetLag code that you are able to run.  You will be able to use this as
the starting point for learning about how games are made, and also as the
starting point for making your own game.
