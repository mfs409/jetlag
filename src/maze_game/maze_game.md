# Example: A Maze Game

This chapter presents a "maze" style of game.  As you're reading through the
code, please focus on how we use an array to describe how to set up the walls.
This idea is related to some of the ways that you could use SVG: in both cases,
it helps you to declare the state of the game as data, instead of having to
implement the state of the game through code.
