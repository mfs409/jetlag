## The Code

Below is all of the code for this game.  Hopefully the comments will help as you
try to understand how the game was made.  In particular, you should pay
attention to the way that the `mazeLayout` lets us create a maze without writing
code for every single block.

```typescript
{{#include game.ts}}
```
